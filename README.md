# Zeta Alpha Challenge

At Zeta Alpha weâ€™re building the [next generation neural discovery platform](https://search.zeta-alpha.com). Our platform allows you to find documents, stay up-to-date on relevant developments, and organize your knowledge discovery work. Our search system is the part that ingests, understands, and retrieves documents from multiple sources.

## Assignment: Implement a search system MVP

In this challenge you will be creating an MVP of the search system. You are provided with a source folder containing multiple PDF documents. Your objective is to implement a solution capable of:
1. Ingesting, parsing, and storing the provided documents
1. Retrieving a list of documents by matching the title, authors, and/or content.

**You can find the source documents [here](https://zeta-alpha-challenge.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/index.html).**

### Deliverables

The result should be in the form of functional code along with documentation for running and using it.

## [Optional] Bonus points

A typical search system includes the following stages:
- An offline stage that periodically polls multiple data sources (external APIs, websites, etc.), processes them, and populates a search database.
- A retrieval stage that allows users to search, rank, and sort the documents from the database.

Some of the challenges we face, when designing a search system, revolve around providing a good experience for both our internal and external users. For example:

1. Allowing data and content managers to easily manage data sources, as well as individual documents within the sources. 
1. Allowing NLP/ML engineers to easily experiment and develop processing workflows.
1. Allowing search engineers to tweak and develop the retrieval process.
1. Allowing end-users to interact with the platform in a fast, reliable, and secure way.

How would you address (some of) these challenges when designing a search system?

## Tips and remarks

- You should not spend more than **4 hours** working on the challenge.
- The coding assignment should be written in **python**.
- You can choose any existing libraries and packages that you deem necessary.
- Expect to be questioned about your technology and architectural decisions, as well as implementation details.
- Work in an agile way. You might not be able to completely solve everything in the assignment, so pick wisely.
- Don't hesitate to contact us with any clarification questions.
